List of considerations:

- What does the program need to do
  - different from gasoline, which is a near perfect substitute with gasoline from other stations, the cheapest bubble tea is not necessarily the best.
  - while gas prices are listed by liter, bubble teas are sold in different unit i.e. small, mid, large. How do we reflect this difference?
  - having maps and distance calculation will be a fundamental part of this program, as bubble tea shop in Vancouver is irrelevant to a UofT student.
    - are there ways to simplify this further? e.g. limit the area covered to St George campus only and disregard the location of the user, such that distance computation can be skipped

- Perhaps we could implement the program for simple commodity first e.g. gasoline, such that we would obtain a base design upon which we could expand on in future phases to account for intricacies of bubble teas and other non-commodity merchandises
