A UofT student is in dire need of a delicious, but cheap bubble tea. What will they do, turn to google? But how will they know the price of the drink without trekking all the way to the store? Ah-Ha Boba Buddy, of course! This student opens the app to be greeted with a map of stores all within walking distance of campus. As most students are , this student needs the best deal possible. So they sort by best price of bubble tea. This request starts with a tap on the screen, invoking the GenericController, which delegates the task to FindItemController. The FindItemController then calls to the findItem class to find all bubble teas and their corresponding price using requestFindAll. This is then presented to our student so a selection can be made. Voila $3.15 for a bubble tea. The student then selects the item. The command for the store details is then sent to the Generic Controller, which delegates the task to another sub controller. The controller then makes a request to the findStore class, while supplying the store id associated with that bubble tea. The FindStore class then interacts with the EntityHashMap to find the store corresponding to that id. Once found the store is then passed to the presenter, then to view to be shown to the student. All relevant information such as location is then displayed to enable the student to start the short walk. After seeing that the price is slightly incorrect, the student decides to update the price. This action is sent through view and to our GenericController once again, which calls the sub controller responsible for updating price. This time the action is then sent to UpdateItem in which the request is fulfilled. This success is then loaded into a presenter and sent to View to ensure the user their update was successful.

The bubble tea was magnificent, and the student feels the store is in reward of a good rating. The student initiates a rating action. It is sent from view to the GenericController where the task is delegated to a sub controller for adding ratings where a command for a new rating is executed. A RatingPoint is added to the EntityHashmap, and it links the user to the review and the review to the bubble tea shop. The success of this review is then sent back to the presenter and then to View for the user to be prompted of success
