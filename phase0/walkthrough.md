A UofT student is in dire need of a delicious, but cheap bubble tea. What will they do, turn to google? But how will they know the price of the drink without trekking all the way to the store? Ah-Ha Boba Buddy, of course! This student opens the app to be greeted with a map of stores all within walking distance of campus. As most students are , this student needs the best deal possible. So they sort by best price of bubble tea. This request starts with a tap on the screen, invoking the GenericController. The generic controller then calls to the EntityHashmap to find all bubble teas and their corresponding price. This is then presented to our student so a selection can be made. Voila $3.15 for a bubble tea. The student then selects the item. The command for the store details is then sent to the Generic Controller. The controller then calls to the EntityHashMap once again, while supplying the store id associated with that bubble tea. EntityHashMap then interacts with the active stores to find the one corresponding to that id. Once found the store is then returned to the GenericController, then to view to be presented to the student. All relevant information such as location is then displayed to enable the student to start the short walk. After seeing that the price is slightly incorrect, the student decides to update the price. This action is sent through view and to our GenericController once again. This time the action is then sent to ItemFacade in which the request of UpdateItem is fulfilled. This success is then sent back through GenericController and View to ensure the user their update was successful.

The bubble tea was magnificent, and the student feels the store is in reward of a good rating. The student initiates a rating action. It is sent from view to the GenericController where the task is delegated to EntityHashMap where a command for a new rating is executed. In this map it will link the user to the review and the review to the bubble tea shop. The success of this review is then sent back to GenericConroller and then to View for the user to be prompted of success
