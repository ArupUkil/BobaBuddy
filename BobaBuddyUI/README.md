# Getting The UI Running
After you have started BobabuddyApplication in src/main/java you will need to install the APK to use our UI. Before following the steps below make sure you have installed and opened a Pixel 4 android emulator.

For help setting up an android emulator see the documentation here: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/create-your-first-android-application.html
After setting up the Android SDK ensure the virtual device created is the Pixel 4.



To get the app running on your android emulator head to /BobaBuddyUI/build/app/outputs/apk/debug/ and drag and drop the app-debug.apk onto your open android emulator. This will automatically initiate an installation of the application on your emulator. After the installation completes, open the app and experience BobaBuddy!
